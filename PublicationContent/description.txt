[h1]📋 Description:[/h1]
This is the same as [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1417081496]Pharrahnox's StartWave[/url], but with some fixes:
[olist]
[*] fixed starting Dosh for Endless mode;
[*] fixed difficulty setting when changing wave;
[*] optimized boss replacement: now it always works successfully and quickly;
[*] players no longer need to download StartWave when connecting to a server.
[/olist]

A utility mod that allows users to specify the starting wave and the boss that will spawn. Additionally, users can jump between waves during the match with a console command (mutate setwave, see below).
The purpose of this mod is to allow mappers to more efficiently test their maps for later waves or for the boss. It could also be used to skip early waves if you find them boring, or to test strategies against a specific boss.
It is designed to be compatible with every mutator and wave-based gamemode, and to require little to no maintenance after game updates.

[h1]❌ Whitelisted?[/h1]
No. This mod is not whitelisted and will de-rank your server. Any XP earned will not be saved.

[h1]🎮 Usage (single player)[/h1]
[olist]
[*]Subscribe to this mutator.
[*]Launch KF2.
[*]Open console (~) and start a game with the mutator:
[code]open KF-BioticsLab?Game=KFGameContent.KFGameInfo_Survival?Difficulty=3?GameLength=2?Mutator=StartWave.Mut[/code]
(replace the map and set/add the parameters you need)
[/olist]

[h1]🖥️ Usage (server)[/h1]
[b]Note:[/b] [i]If this is unclear, first read: [url=https://wiki.killingfloor2.com/index.php?title=Dedicated_Server_(Killing_Floor_2)][u]Dedicated Server Guide (KF2 wiki)[/u][/url][/i]
[olist]
[*]Open [b]PCServer-KFEngine.ini[/b] / [b]LinuxServer-KFEngine.ini[/b].
[*]Find [b][IpDrv.TcpNetDriver][/b] section and ensure line exists (add if missing):
[code]DownloadManagers=OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.SteamWorkshopDownload[/code]
(If there are several [b]DownloadManagers[/b] then the line above should be the first)
[*]Add the following string to the [b][OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.KFWorkshopSteamworks][/b] section (create one if it doesn't exist):
[code]ServerSubscribedWorkshopItems=2521731447[/code]
[*]Start server and wait for mutator download.
[*]When the download is complete, stop the server.
[*]Add mutator (with parameters you need) to server start parameters:
[code]?Mutator=StartWave.Mut[/code]
[*]Start the server.
[/olist]

[h1]⚙️ Mutator setup (KFStartWave.ini)[/h1]
The parameters below can be used as parameters in the startup line.
But You can use a config if you don't want to specify parameters in the startup line:
Create a file [b]KFGame/Config/KFStartWave.ini[/b] and copy this text into it:
[code]
[StartWave.StartWave]
// Any settings not specified in the launch command will use the values stored here.
// If you use the same settings often, it is recommended to store those here
// and only change what you need in the launch command.

// LogLevel (Set this to 'LL_Debug' if you need more information in the log)
LogLevel=LL_Info

// Whether an 'initial' trader time should occur before the first wave.
bStartWithTrader=false

// The wave that the match should start on. It is clamped between wave 1 and the boss wave.
StartWave=1

// The duration of the 'initial' trader (before the first wave).
InitialTraderTime=60

// The duration of standard trader (between waves).
TraderTime=60

// The starting dosh of players.
Dosh=250

// The boss override index.
// For the default boss list, 0-Hans, 1-Patty, 2-King FP, 3-Abomination.
// Negative values can be used to keep the boss spawn random.
Boss=-1
[/code]
You can change the config as you need.

[b]The setwave command[/b]
To jump to any wave during the match, use the setwave command which has the definition: mutate setwave WaveNum bSkipTraderTime. Cheats must be enabled for this command to work.

Example usages (all to be typed into the console):
[code]
mutate setwave 5 true  // jump to wave 5 with no trader time.
mutate setwave 3 false // jump to wave 3 with trader time.
mutate setwave 3       // identical to the above (the last parameter defaults to false).
[/code]

You can jump forwards or backwards between waves (e.g. from 5 -> 2 -> 8 -> 3, etc.)

[h1]🐞 If not working[/h1]
Older versions of StartWave have the same file names - this can cause conflicts if you subscribe to them. Therefore:
[olist]
[*]Check your subscriptions. If you are subscribed to old versions of the mutator, cancel them.
[*]Clear the cache, it's here:
[b]Client:[/b]
[code]
C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\Documents\My Games\KillingFloor2\KFGame\Cache\
[/code]
[b]Server:[/b]
[code]
<KF2_DIR>/Binaries/Win64/steamapps/workshop/content/232090/
<KF2_DIR>/KFGame/Cache/
[/code]
[*]Try starting the game/server again.

[h1]☑️ Status: Completed[/h1]
✔️ The mutator works with the current version of the game (v1150) and I have implemented everything I planned.
